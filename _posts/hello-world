title: What is Curl, Div, Undergrad even about? 
---

Hello $\text{every} \ \int_{0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^n e^{-x} \mathrm{d}x}{\tau(n+1)}}$. Yes, it's exactly what it looks like - a (b)log where I talk about curl, div (multivariable calculus - or more generally, mathematics and physics), or undergrad, and rant some other things I've been thinking about.
